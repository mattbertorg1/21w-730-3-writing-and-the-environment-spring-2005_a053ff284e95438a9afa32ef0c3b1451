description: This file asks students to develop a narrative framework for their original
  description and asks them to tell their readers a story that will help to understand
  them reasons for remembering the place (or animal). The story need not lead  toward
  a dramatic conclusion, but it should allow to share in any insight that they derived
  from their original experience (or from writing about that experience).
